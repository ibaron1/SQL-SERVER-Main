To ignore error, capture it and continue yse

begin try
end try
begin catch
end catch

inside loops

capture error and log it, do not use Throw or Raiserror - both will stop execution

check the execution log for error and throw error at the end of a run - ask Jim or R whatever app guy if they can catch Throw or need Raiserror
