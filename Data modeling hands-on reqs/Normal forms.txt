First Normal Form (1NF): 

    a single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
    there must be a primary key for identification
    no duplicated rows or columns
    each column must have only one value for each row in the table

Second Normal Form – 2NF

The 1NF only eliminates repeating groups, not redundancy. That’s why there is 2NF.

A table is said to be in 2NF if it meets the following criteria:

    it’s already in 1NF
    has no partial dependency. That is, all non-key attributes are fully dependent on a primary key.

The Third Normal Form – 3NF

When a table is in 2NF, it eliminates repeating groups and redundancy, but it does not eliminate transitive partial dependency.

This means a non-prime attribute (an attribute that is not part of the candidate’s key) is dependent on another non-prime attribute. This is what the third normal form (3NF) eliminates.

So, for a table to be in 3NF, it must:

    be in 2NF
    have no transitive partial dependency.
