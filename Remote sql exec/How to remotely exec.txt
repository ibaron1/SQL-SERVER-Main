SQL SERVER – Executing Remote Stored Procedure – Calling Stored Procedure on Linked Server

This is very detailed topic, I will keep it very simple.

I am making assumptions that remote server is already set up as linked server with proper permissions in application and network is arranged.

Method 1 : Remote Stored Procedure can be called as four part name:
Syntax: 

EXEC [RemoteServer] .DatabaseName.DatabaseOwner.StoredProcedureName  ‘Params’


Example: 

EXEC [DEVSQL] .AdventureWorks.dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers ’42'

Method 2 : Use Distributed Query functions (OpenQuery())
Syntax: SELECT * 

FROM OPENQUERY([RemoteServer],DatabaseName.DatabaseOwner.StoredProcedureName)

Example: SELECT *

FROM OPENQUERY([DEVSQL],AdventureWorks.dbo.spAdmin_GetAllUsers)
